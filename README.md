# Speedrun-Timer

This project was created in 2017.

Speedrun Timer is a timer for Android that allows you to specify the number of seconds as a floating point number.
It is aimed at people who speedrun video games (as the name implies), but it could be useful to anyone who needs
a precise countdown with sound effects.
